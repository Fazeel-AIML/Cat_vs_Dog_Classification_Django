# Car and Dog Classification with CNN

Welcome to the Car and Dog Classification project! This project demonstrates a deep learning model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images into two categories: Cars and Dogs. The model is integrated into a web microservice for easy access and interaction.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a CNN model capable of distinguishing between images of cars and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and evaluated for its performance using accuracy metrics. Additionally, a web microservice is provided for deploying and interacting with the model.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify images into two categories - Car and Dog.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Utilizes CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification.
- **Web Microservice**: A simple web service that exposes an API endpoint for image classification.
- **Visualization**: Includes a GIF demonstrating the working of the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Flask (for the web service)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Django

You can install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras flask numpy matplotlib opencv-python
